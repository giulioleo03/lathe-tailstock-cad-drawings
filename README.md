# lathe-tailstock-cad-drawings

AutoCAD drawings for the design of a CNE6/R tailstock, based on the NuovaPTM catalog.  
The repository includes detailed manufacturing drawings of the three main components of the tailstock: the tip, the shaft, and the body.  
An assembly drawing is also provided, including the bill of materials (BOM) and the integration of bearings, seals, and threaded elements.  
Finally, a technical documentation file is included, providing engineering justification for the design decisions made during the drafting process.
